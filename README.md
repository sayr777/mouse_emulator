##  User Session Authorization Controller

The controller must be connected to the computer via a USB port. When the user brings the HID card to the controller's reader, the controller authorizes the user in Windows.
The controller with the program running tries to emulate the operation of a computer mouse. The computer cannot close the desktop because the system cannot detect that the user has finished working with the computer.
If the hidden card is in the reader, the Windows operating system will not be able to close the desktop. Every 30 seconds, it accidentally moves the mouse cursor, thereby preventing the screen from being blocked.
